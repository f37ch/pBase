### Installation ###
1. Place the contents of this repo except lua folder into your site root directory.
2. Configure your database with php settings and Apache premissions to allow write/read files in root and all subdirectories.
3. Setup config.php file located at `components` and autodonate modules located at `modules/autodonate`.
3. Create a new addon folder within your `garrysmod/addons/` directory and place lua contents into it (you prob need to modify lua code based on your server admin mood and needs).
